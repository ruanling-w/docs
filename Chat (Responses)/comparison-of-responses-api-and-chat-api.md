· Features: Combines the simplicity of Chat Completions with the ability to perform more proxy tasks
· Recommended for: New users
· Built-in tools: Web search, file search, computer usage
Chat Completions API
· Positioning: The industry standard for building AI applications
· Features: Stable, widely used
· Future plans: OpenAI plans to support it indefinitely

## When to Use the Response API

The Responses API is our latest core API, a proxy API primitive that combines the ease of chat completion with the ability to perform more proxy tasks. As model capabilities continue to evolve, the Responses API will become a flexible foundation for building action-oriented applications and includes the following built-in tools:
