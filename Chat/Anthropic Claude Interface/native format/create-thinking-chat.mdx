                temperature:
                  type: integer
                  description: >-
                    The sampling temperature to use is between 0 and 2. Higher values ​​(such as 0.8) will make the output more random, while lower values ​​(such as 0.2) will make the output more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend changing this or `top_p`, but not both.
                top_p:
                  type: integer
                  description: >-
                    An alternative to temperature sampling is called kernel sampling, where the model considers the results of labels with a top_p probability quality. So 0.1 means only labels constituting the top 10% probability quality are considered. We generally recommend changing this or `temperature`, but not both.
                "n":
                  type: integer
                  description: |-
                    The default value is 1.
                    How many chat completion options to generate for each input message.
                stream:
                  type: boolean
                  description: >-
                    The default value is false. If set, partial message increments will be sent, similar to ChatGPT. The flag will be sent as data-only server-sent events, which will occur when available and in the data: [DONE] message stream termination event. Python code example.
                stop:
                  type: string
                  description: The default value is null. A maximum of 4 sequences will be generated before the API stops generating further tags.
                max_tokens:
                  type: integer
                  description: |-
                    The default value is inf
                    The maximum number of tags generated in chat autocomplete.

                    The total length of the input and generated tags is limited by the model's context length. Example Python code for calculating tags.
                presence_penalty:
                  type: number
                  description: >-
                    A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values ​​penalize new tokens based on whether they have appeared in the text so far, thus increasing the likelihood that the model will discuss new topics.

                    [See more information on frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)
                frequency_penalty:
                  type: number
                  description: >-
                    The default value is a number between 0 and 2.0, with a positive value between 2.0 and 2.0. Positive values ​​penalize new tags based on the current frequency of the text's presence, reducing the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines.

                    More information on frequency and presence penalties.
                logit_bias:
                  type: "null"
                  description: >-
                    Modify the likelihood of a specified tag appearing in the completion.


                    This accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (to token IDs specified by the tokenizer) to associated bias values ​​(-100 to 100). Mathematically, the bias is added to the logit generated by the model before sampling. The exact effect varies by model, but values ​​between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase the likelihood of selecting the associated token; values ​​like -100 or 100 should result in the associated token being disabled or exclusively selected.

                    Specifies the format of the object that the model must output. Setting `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures that the messages generated by the model are valid JSON. Important: When using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to generate JSON via a system or user message. Failure to do so may result in the model generating an endless stream of empty tokens until the token limit is reached, leading to increased latency and a "stuck" appearance for requests. Also note that if `finish_reason="length"`, the message content may be partially truncated, indicating that more than `max_tokens` has been generated or the conversation has exceeded the maximum context length.

                    This feature is in the testing phase. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically so that repeated requests using the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism cannot be guaranteed; you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor backend changes.

                    Controls which function the model calls (if any). `none` means the model will not call the function but will generate a message. `auto` means the model can choose between generating a message and calling the function. Force the model to call the function using `{"type": "function", "function":
                    {"name": "my_function"}}`. If no function exists, the default is `none`. If a function exists, the default is `auto`. Displays possible types.
