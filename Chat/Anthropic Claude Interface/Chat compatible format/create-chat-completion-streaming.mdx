Stream tokens as they are generated by the model. This endpoint is compatible with the OpenAI format.

### Request Body

<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
  The ID of the model to use.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="messages" type="array" required>
  List of messages comprising the conversation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="stream" type="boolean" default="true" required>
  Must be set to `true` for streaming.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_tokens" type="integer">
  Maximum tokens to generate.
</ParamField>

                    Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (token IDs as specified by the tokenizer) to an associated bias value (-100 to 100). Mathematically, the bias is added to the model-generated logit before sampling. The exact effect varies per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase the likelihood of selecting the associated token; values like -100 or 100 should result in disabling or exclusively selecting the associated token.

                    Object specifying the format the model must output. Setting { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the model-generated message is valid JSON. Important: When using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to generate JSON via a system or user message. If not, the model may generate endless blank streams until the token limit is reached, causing increased latency and a "stuck" request. Also note, if finish_reason="length", the message content may be partially cut off, indicating generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the maximum context length. Show properties

                    This feature is experimental. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically so that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed; you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor backend changes.

                    Controls which function the model calls (if any). none means the model will not call a function and will generate a message. auto means the model can choose between generating a message and calling a function. Use {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} to force the model to call that function. If no functions exist, defaults to none. If functions exist, defaults to auto.
