This endpoint supports models with extended thinking, allowing for deeper reasoning before providing an answer.

### Request Body

<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
  The thinking-capable model ID (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="messages" type="array" required>
  Conversation history.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="thinking" type="object">
  Configuration for extended thinking.
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="enabled">
      Set to `enabled` to activate extended thinking.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="budget_tokens" type="integer">
      The maximum number of tokens to spend on thinking.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

                  description: >-
                    Default is 0. Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, reducing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line. See more about frequency and presence penalties.
                logit_bias:
                  type: "null"

                    Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.


                    Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (token IDs as specified by the tokenizer) to an associated bias value (-100 to 100). Mathematically, the bias is added to the model-generated logit before sampling. The exact effect varies per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase the likelihood of selecting the associated token; values like -100 or 100 should result in disabling or exclusively selecting the associated token.

                    Object specifying the format the model must output. Setting { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which ensures the model-generated message is valid JSON. Important: When using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to generate JSON via a system or user message. If not, the model may generate endless blank streams until the token limit is reached, causing increased latency and a "stuck" request. Also note, if finish_reason="length", the message content may be partially cut off, indicating generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the maximum context length. Show properties

                    This feature is experimental. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically so that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed; you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor backend changes.

                    Controls which function the model calls (if any). none means the model will not call a function and will generate a message. auto means the model can choose between generating a message and calling a function. Use {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} to force the model to call that function. If no functions exist, defaults to none. If functions exist, defaults to auto.
