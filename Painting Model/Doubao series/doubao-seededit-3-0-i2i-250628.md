        Given a prompt and/or an input image, the model will generate a new image.

        Create an image based on the prompt.

                    For the image to be edited, enter the Base64 encoded image or an accessible URL.

                    Image URL: Ensure the image URL is accessible.

                    Base64 Encoding: Follow this format: data:image/<image format>;base64,<Base64 encoding>. Note that <image format>

                    must be lowercase, e.g., data:image/png;base64,<base64_image>.

                    Instructions

                    The image must meet the following conditions:

                    Image format: jpeg, png.

                    Aspect ratio (width/height): within the range (1/3, 3).

                    Width and height (px) > 14.

                    Size: No more than 10MB.
                response_format:
                  type: string
                  description: |-
                    Specifies the return format of the generated image. Two values ​​are supported:
                    url: Returns the image as a downloadable JPEG image link.
                    b64_json: Returns the image data as a Base64 encoded string in JSON format.

                    Default value: url

                  type: string
                  description: >-
                    The width and height of the generated image in pixels. Currently, only adaptive is supported.

                    Adaptive. Compares your input image dimensions with the dimensions in the table below and selects the closest one as the output image size. Specifically, it will select the first aspect ratio from the available options with the smallest difference from the original image's aspect ratio as the generated image's aspect ratio.
                seed:
                  type: integer
                  description: >-
                    The random number seed controls the randomness of the content generated by the model. Its value ranges from [-1, 2^31-1], that is, an integer between [-1, 2147483647].
                    If not provided, the algorithm automatically generates a random number as the seed. To ensure consistent content generation, the same seed parameter value can be used.

                    Default value: -1
                guidance_scale:
                  type: number
                  description: >-
                    The degree of influence of text description and input image on the generated image. Value range: [1, 10]
                    A floating-point number. A larger value indicates a greater influence of the text description and a smaller influence of the input image.

                    Default value: 5.5
                watermark:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |-
                    Add a watermark to the generated image.
                    false: Do not add a watermark.
                    true: Add an "AI Generated" watermark to the bottom right corner of the image.
                    Default: true
